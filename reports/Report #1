- Once everyone has had a chance to fill each role, we will decide who suits each best, 
  or continue swapping back and forth.

# Meeting Schedule
- Meetings will be held Monday evenings, Friday afternoons or Saturday
  evenings, based on the schedules of all group members.

- Meetings will be held in-person, at least once a week, but can be as often
  as needed.

- Additional meetings will be held on Discord or over ZOOM.

# Communication Plan
- Our main forms of communication will be through Discord and GitHub.

- Disagreements regarding design choices will be taken to a vote, decided 
  by a 2/3s majority.

- If a team member is found to be underperforming, the manager will send a 
  message through Discord to let the teammate know how the rest of the group 
  is feeling, or it will be discussed in the next meeting.

# Project Idea
- Our proposed product is a scheduling web application designed to facilitate 
  the reservation and use of Gaming PCâ€™s in the Advanced Media Lab on campus.

- The main functionalities include:
  * Identification of available PCs
  * The ability to reserve a PC for up to 4 hours 
    (more time may be permitted, if necessary)
  * Identification of user reservation

  **Possibly get permission to identify NAU ID to reservations**
  **Possibly have it tie into Google Calendar Reminder**

- Technologies and Languages Being Utilized:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * C++
  * GitHub
  * VSCode
  * React.js
  * CLion
  * Node.js

  **Possibly Swift**
  **Possibly Android Studio and XCode**
  **Possibly Duo for NAU ID Login**

# Next Steps
- Ali:
  * Design wireframes and mockups for task creation
  * Build the foundational structure of the web app using the chosen frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular)
  * Create design systems with reusable components (buttons, modals, etc.)
  * Implement the designed UI components (e.g., calendar interface, task forms)

- Anthony:
  * Design wireframes and mockups for the structural database
  * Define test cases for core features
  * Perform manual and automated testing (e.g., Selenium, Playwright)


  * Set up the backend server (e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, or Flask)
  * Design APIs for data interactions (e.g., CRUD operations for tasks and events)
  * Implement authentication and user management (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
  * Integrate a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

  * Set up the development environment (e.g., Docker for containerization)
  * Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated builds, testing, and deployment
  * Set up cloud hosting (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Vercel)
  * Ensure scalable architecture for future growth

  * Identify and report bugs or UI inconsistencies


- Clayton:
  * Design wireframes and mockups for login page
  * Ensure the design is responsive and adheres to accessibility standards
  * Ensure the application is responsive and cross-browser compatible

- Vince
  * Design wireframes and mockups for reservation fetching

- Zack
  * Design wireframes and mockups for calendar view
  * Build the foundational structure of the web app using the chosen frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular)
  * Handle state management for frontend data (e.g., Redux, Vuex, or Context API)
