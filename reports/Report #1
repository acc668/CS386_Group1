# Meeting Schedule
- Meetings will be held Monday evenings, Friday afternoons or Saturday
  evenings, based on the schedules of all group members.

- Meetings will be held in-person, at least once a week, but can be as often
  as needed.

- Additional meetings will be held on Discord or over ZOOM.

# Communication Plan
- Our main forms of communication will be through Discord and GitHub.

- Disagreements regarding design choices will be taken to a vote, decided 
  by a 2/3s majority.

- If a team member is found to be underperforming, the manager will send a 
  message through Discord to let the teammate know how the rest of the group 
  is feeling, or it will be discussed in the next meeting.

# Project Idea
- Our proposed product is a scheduling web application designed to facilitate 
  the reservation and use of Gaming PCâ€™s in the Advanced Media Lab on campus.

- The main functionalities include:
  * Identification of available PCs
  * The ability to reserve a PC for up to 4 hours 
    (more time may be permitted, if necessary)
  * Identification of user reservation

  **Possibly get permission to identify NAU ID to reservations**
  **Possibly have it tie into Google Calendar Reminder**

- Technologies and Languages Being Utilized:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * C++
  * GitHub
  * VSCode
  * React.js
  * CLion
  * Node.js

  **Possibly Swift**
  **Possibly Android Studio and XCode**
  **Possibly Duo for NAU ID Login**
