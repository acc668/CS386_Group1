# Deliverable 6

## Introduction

**Q-Up** is an integrated scheduling application designed to streamline event management and PC scheduling. It offers a user-friendly web interface alongside a robust C++ core module, ensuring efficient planning and communication. The web application, developed with JavaScript and Node.js, provides an interactive platform for users to organize events seamlessly. Complementing this, the C++ core module handles complex backend processing, delivering reliable and swift performance.

Together, these components create a cohesive system that enhances user experience in event coordination and resource scheduling.

## Code Quality

Our team prioritized code quality by establishing clear conventions and best practices from the start. We agreed on consistent naming conventions, modular file structures, and documentation within code to enhance readability and maintainability. All code contributions were submitted through GitHub pull requests, which were reviewed by at least one other team member before merging. This peer review process helped catch bugs early, enforce standards, and share knowledge. We also referenced user stories to ensure each feature met its intended purpose and fit cleanly into the overall system architecture.

## Lessons Learned

During the second release, our team learned the importance of early integration and consistent communication. Coordinating both frontend and backend components required clear planning and version control discipline, especially when merging features that touched shared files. We also gained a better understanding of how user feedback and real-world testing shape feature prioritization. While we continue developing the project, we will most likely implement automated testing earlier in the process, improve documentation, and consider using a framework or component library to speed up UI development and ensure consistency across pages.
