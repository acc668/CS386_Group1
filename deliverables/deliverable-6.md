## Tests

Due to factors such as conflicting schedules, lack of communication, and misunderstanding of testing requirements, no automated testing was conducted for implementation two.

## Code Quality

To maintain code quality, our team agreed on a consistent document structure and naming convention for the files in the project. Each page corresponded to its own file from the beginning of the project, which allowed the development to be modular and easy to maintain. Additionally, contributions to the project required a different team member to review and approve the pull request. This helped ensure that there was a peer review process in place and that bugs with code functionality were caught early on.

## Lessons Learned

Implementation two helped us learn about the importance of communication and early integration of project requirements. Communication was especially important when it came to implementing features that interacted with both the front and the back end as these are more likely to cause merge conflicts. The team also learned about the importance of testing and development centered around testing as this allows the preservation of the quality and functionality of our project. We do need to implement more automated testing, however, as this will test for more edge cases than the manual testing we have done so far.
