## System Description

The problem of unreliable and inefficient scheduling in the **Advanced Media Lab (AML)** affects all participants, including **Competitive Players**, **Casual Players**, **Spectators**, **Organizers**, and **Advisors**. The impact of this issue is confusion, missed matches, and a fragmented experience, leading to difficulty in coordinating games, last-minute cancellations, and an inconsistent event flow. This reduces engagement and diminishes the overall enjoyment of the league.  

For **AML Attendees** who struggle with these scheduling issues, **Q-Up** is an advanced scheduling application that streamlines match organization by providing a **Reservation System** for PCs, a **Calendar** for listing **Events**, and tools for tracking **Team Reservations**, ensuring smoother coordination and better communication. Unlike manual scheduling methods or generic scheduling tools, **Q-Up** is specifically designed for **AML**, offering a centralized platform to manage ***PC Availability*** and ***Event Scheduling***, reducing conflicts and improving the overall league experience.  

**Q-Up** gives **Competitive Players** reassurance that they will have PCs for games while ensuring **Casual Players** can still utilize the space by allowing **AML Attendees** to ***Reserve*** PCs. The system's primary functionalities center around a robust **Reservation System** that allows **Competitive Players** to ***Reserve*** specific PCs in advance for practice or scheduled matches. **Casual Players** can also request ***Reservations***, but **Competitive Players** receive ***Priority Scheduling*** for official matches.  

The ***PC Availability*** feature dynamically updates, ensuring that users always have an up-to-date view of which PCs are available and when. Additionally, the **Calendar** displays upcoming **Events**, match schedules, and available time slots, helping **Spectators** stay informed about important games and ensuring **Organizers** can coordinate efficiently.  

To enhance communication, **Q-Up** includes **Automated Notifications**, which alert **AML Attendees** about upcoming ***Reservations***, changes in schedule, and conflicts in ***PC Reservations***. This prevents double bookings and reduces confusion. **Q-Up** also integrates a **Warning System**, notifying **Casual Players** occupying a PC when a **Competitive Player** has a ***Reservation*** scheduled, ensuring smooth transitions and minimizing disputes.  

From a development perspective, **Group 1 Developers** are responsible for building and maintaining the system with a focus on scalability, ease of updates, and adherence to **NAU IT Staff** security standards. The system will ensure compliance with university regulations while providing an intuitive, accessible interface for **AML Attendees**.  

By providing a structured and reliable **Reservation System**, real-time ***PC Availability*** tracking, and an integrated **Calendar**, **Q-Up** significantly enhances the **AML** experience, making it easier for all participants to engage with competitive and casual gaming in a well-organized environment.
