## Introduction
Our project is a web-based reservation system designed for students in the AML, enabling them to book specific PCs for competitive play, while still allowing casual players to use the space without disruption. This software ensures fair and efficient access to gaming resources by allowing competitive players to secure dedicated time slots, while notifying current users when a computer is reserved. Casual players can continue using available PCs without worrying about sudden disruptions or being forced to switch computers.
By streamlining the reservation process and preventing conflicts, our solution supports both competitive and casual players, fostering an organized and inclusive gaming environment.

## Initial Value Proposition & Customer Segment(s)
The Advanced Media Lab is a high-traffic on-campus computer lab.
Our scheduling software, **Q-up**, is designed to reduce student frustration when the lab reaches full capacity. While not a necessity, **Q-up** enhances convenience for students seeking to use the AML. Our primary audience is AML attendees, but the software can also help encourage broader use by other students and faculty.
What sets **Q-up** apart is its real-time updates, allowing users to monitor PC availability and minimize scheduling conflicts.
