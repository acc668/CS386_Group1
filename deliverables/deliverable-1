##Introduction
  Our project is a web-based reservation system designed for students in the AML, 
  enabling them to book specific PCs for competitive play, while still allowing 
  casual players to use the space without disruption. This software ensures fair 
  and efficient access to gaming resources by allowing competitive players to 
  secure dedicated time slots, while notifying current users when a computer 
  is reserved. Casual players can continue using available PCs without worrying 
  about sudden disruptions or being forced to switch computers. 
  By streamlining the reservation process and preventing conflicts, our solution 
  supports both competitive and casual players, fostering an organized and inclusive gaming environment.

##Initial Value Proposition & Customer Segment(s)
  The Advanced Media Lab is a high-traffic on-campus computer lab. 
  Our scheduling software, Q-up, is designed to reduce student frustration 
  when the lab reaches full capacity. While not a necessity, Q-up enhances 
  convenience for students seeking to use the AML. Our primary audience is AML 
  attendees, but the software can also help encourage broader use by other students 
  and faculty. What sets Q-up apart is its real-time updates, allowing users to monitor
  PC availability and minimize scheduling conflicts.
